# InterviewTask
## First Step
### Divide The word in portions like m - me -men -menn -menna.

### every portion will be from 0 to $i and we count from 0 to input length.

## Second Step
### now we will compare every portion with a portion with the same length in the secondd parameter.



## Third Step
### check if the character after portion in input is not equale  the character after portion in input1 to avoid duplication.

## Fourth Step
### if second and third step is true we will increment counter by 1;

## Fifth Step
### check if current portion is the word itself if the case is true  we will ignore third step and  we will increment the counter.

# last step
